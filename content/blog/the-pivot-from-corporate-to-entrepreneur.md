In 2019, I left a comfortable engineering management role to start my own company. Three years later, I returned to corporate life. Here's what that journey taught me.

## Why I Left

I was good at my job. But I wanted to know if I could build something from nothing. The entrepreneurial itch was real — and ignoring it felt worse than scratching it.

## What I Built

I co-founded a consulting practice focused on inclusive software development. We built products, trained teams, and tried to prove that diversity in engineering isn't just ethical — it's profitable.

## What I Learned

1. **Sales is engineering's twin** — Building the product is half the battle. Selling it is the other half, and it's harder.
2. **Cash flow is oxygen** — Beautiful code means nothing if you can't make payroll.
3. **Leadership is leadership** — Whether you're managing 30 engineers or 3 contractors, the fundamentals are the same: clarity, empathy, accountability.

## Why I Came Back

I didn't fail — I chose to return. The startup experience made me a fundamentally better engineering leader. I now bring founder-level urgency to every team I join.
