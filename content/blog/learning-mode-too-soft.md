When I jumped back into development, I knew I didn't want AI to just write code for me. I'd already seen what happens when developers let AI do all the heavy lifting — you ship features you can't explain, you fix bugs by asking the AI to fix them, and your actual engineering skills quietly atrophy. I wanted to use AI to augment my development, but I needed to actually *learn* while I worked.

This is the first post in a three-part series about how I found the right balance. Think of it as a Goldilocks story. As I returned to development, AI made me feel lost, much like Goldilocks. I recognized the general ideas, the rooms, the food. But it was still a little foreign to me. I wanted to make sure that as I explored this new space, I found exactly the right fit for me and my goals. This first story is my mama bear, too soft, too cold, too...easy.

## The Project

I was building a Python application that parses text from images and arranges them in a timeline to support legal filings for bad coparenting experiences. I had done a small amount of Python coding before, enough to be dangerous but not enough to be productive. This was a perfect example of how I knew AI could help me move through this project quickly, while also helping me learn.

## The Approach

I opened up [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in VSCode and gave it a rundown of what I wanted to build. But instead of asking it to create a plan or write the code, I tried something different:

*"Instead of creating a plan, or writing it yourself, turn this project into a tutorial."*

And it did. Copilot made assumptions about how many hours I'd be able to spend per day. It set up multiple stages, each one building on the last, each providing some level of value along the way. Instead of writing the code directly into my files, it showed it to me...and I typed it into the editor myself.

On the surface, this felt like learning.

## What I Actually Learned

Not a whole lot.

Yes, I spent time thinking about what I was typing. I read each line before I entered it. Copilot explained what each section did and why it was structured that way. It all made sense in the moment. There were times when I recognized the app made assumptions about my instructions, and I applied my own thinking to fix the problem.

But 98% of the time, I was really just transcribing. I was copying code from one pane to another, and the act of typing it didn't make me understand it any better than reading it would have. The explanations landed while I was in the flow...but afterwards...

## Mom Doing Your Homework

This was learning on easy mode. It was like watching your mom do your math homework while she explained every step. It all made sense — the formulas, the logic, the approach. You nodded along. You felt good about it.

Then you went to sleep and had a test the next morning and the only clear answer you had was your name.

This wasn't a whole lot more helpful than letting the AI write the code for me. I was just slowing it down. The tutorial format gave me the *feeling* of learning without the struggle that actually makes things stick.

## What Was Missing

The problem wasn't Copilot's tutorial — it was genuinely well-structured. The problem was that I had no skin in the game. I wasn't making decisions. I wasn't being challenged. I wasn't failing and recovering. I was following instructions perfectly, which is the least effective way to learn anything complex.

I needed more friction. So for my next project, I overcorrected.

## What's Next

In the next post, I swing to the other extreme — Papa Bear mode...
