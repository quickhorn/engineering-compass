AI coding assistants are everywhere. But most engineers use them like autocomplete on steroids. Here's how to actually get value from them.

## My Daily AI Stack

- **Cursor / Copilot** for in-editor completions
- **ChatGPT / Claude** for architectural discussions and code review
- **Lovable** for rapid prototyping of full-stack features

## The Rules I Follow

### 1. AI writes the first draft, I write the final version
Never ship AI-generated code without reviewing it. AI is great at boilerplate but bad at understanding your specific business context.

### 2. Use AI for exploration, not production
When evaluating a new library or pattern, I'll ask AI to generate example implementations. This saves hours of reading docs.

### 3. Pair programming with AI
I treat Claude like a junior developer. I explain the problem, review its solution, and iterate. The conversation itself often clarifies my own thinking.

## What AI Can't Do (Yet)

- Understand your team's coding conventions deeply
- Make architectural decisions with full business context
- Replace code review — it catches syntax, not strategy

## The Bottom Line

AI makes good engineers faster. It doesn't make bad engineers good. Invest in fundamentals first, then amplify with AI.
