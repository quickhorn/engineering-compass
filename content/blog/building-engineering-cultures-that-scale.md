Great engineering cultures don't happen by accident. They're intentionally designed, nurtured, and reinforced at every level of the organization.

## The Problem

When I joined TheoremOne, the engineering team was growing fast. New hires were productive within weeks, but something was missing — they weren't *owners*. They shipped features but didn't feel responsible for the product.

## The Approach

I created a day-one onboarding ritual: every new developer sat with me for 30 minutes. Not to review architecture diagrams or Jira boards, but to talk about **why we build the way we build**.

We discussed:
- **Ownership over tickets** — you don't just close a ticket, you own the outcome
- **Radical candor** — say what needs to be said, with respect
- **Learning in public** — share your mistakes, they're the best documentation

## The Results

Within six months:
- PR review turnaround dropped from 48 hours to under 12
- Team-initiated improvements increased 3x
- Retention improved significantly — people stayed because they felt like owners

The lesson? Culture isn't a slide deck. It's a daily practice.
