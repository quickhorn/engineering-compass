## Coming Back to Development

After years in people leadership and entrepreneurship, I've decided it's time to return to my roots and come back to development. The lines between people leadership, product, engineering, and design are blurring. From vibe code tools like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), which allow anyone to build amazing, interactive apps that produce not-terrible code (where my own website started), to Agentic AI paradigms like [RALPH loops](https://linearb.io/blog/ralph-loop-agentic-engineering-geoffrey-huntley), which create a structure for self-managed software development agents — the way we build software is shifting significantly.

## How AI Is Changing Development

### What Developers Do Now

Developers spend less time:

* Building boilerplate code
* Arguing with HTML and CSS
* Deep diving into the mechanics of a language

They spend significantly more time:

* Understanding how their product impacts their customer
* Identifying and managing good software practices
* Building quick POCs and killing them just as quickly

### The New Developer Skillset

Every developer needs skills to interact with customers, to ask questions to get to the heart of a ticket, and to communicate effectively with the rest of their team. These skills were usually built over years, and came with a senior title.

So does that mean there's no room for junior developers? Not at all. Recently at Utah Tech Week, Ryan Probasco, Sr Director of Engineering at Pinterest TwoTwenty, answered a question about if they still hire Jr. Devs. He was clear that junior devs were still incredibly important to teams, they still give them easy tickets, but that the turnaround time on those tickets is significantly faster. Which means the junior devs need improved communication skills.

He also reported that they needed to spend more time ensuring the junior devs know *why* they're making the change. His teams have junior devs have their AI review commits, sometimes more than once, before committing. This is also where **Learning Mode** for Augmented AI is incredibly powerful (more on that in coming blog posts).

## How AI Is Changing Management

As developers shift to becoming product makers, managers have to change their stance as well. A team can create a process of doing architecture trade-off discussions using competing AIs, instead of coming to their manager to call the direction. Good commit processes with commit-review agents are just as likely to catch bad code or bad assumptions as managers spot checking pull requests.

### Get Back in the Code

I used to believe that managers should stay out of the code. It produced a higher level of growth for the developers, and improved the level of accountability they have for their own code.

Managers can't stay out of the code anymore. It's now easier to commit alongside your team and use the same AI tools to check your code, instead of hoping your devs feel comfortable thrashing your last commit.

### Invest in Developer Experience

If you want to maintain that level of separation from your devs' velocity and your ability to contribute, you can also spend more time improving your team's [Developer Experience (DevEx)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/developer-experience).

* Take on the responsibility of building agents that move PRs along the pipeline
* Improve survey interactions so your devs can communicate where their pain points are
* Collaborate with Staff and Principal level developers to define high quality agent directions to improve the AI-augmented interactions (like **Learning Mode**!)
* **Train your team on how to use AI**
* Use AI to better understand your team members, record 1:1s (with their permission), build custom learning/growth paths

Just as developers' jobs have changed immensely, so too must managers'.

## What's Next

In my upcoming blog posts, I'll be talking about how I approach structuring my new management role, using **Learning Mode** to quickly bring my technical skills up to modern expectations, delivering quickly, and fighting AI-driven cognitive-atrophy.
